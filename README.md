# Todo-list-project
This Python To-Do List application enables users to manage tasks through a command-line interface. Users can add, view, and delete tasks, with data stored in a JSON file for persistence. The app loads existing tasks at startup and saves changes automatically. It's a simple way to practice Python programming and file Handling.
